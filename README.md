### Welcome! 👋
#### My name is Zachary Di Salvo and I am a versatile software developer with experience in building scalable and efficient data driven backend Java applications with SQL and NoSQL. It is my passion to learn and further my skill set in all areas of software development with a team of exceptional talent. Originating from the residential mortgage industry, I have developed a sound work ethic for seeing transactions through to the finish line under a tight deadline, constantly overcoming hurdles through teamwork and timely problem solving along the way. I thrive in challenging environments where I can get myself unstuck while undertaking complex algorithms and projects. In my spare time I enjoy painting, reading, tennis, surfing, and weightlifting. I have a bachelors degree in Business Economics from UCLA and recently finished a nine month Java backend developer program at Bloomtech. I currently live in San Jose, California and I am open to relocating for an exciting opportunity to launch my career as a developer.
